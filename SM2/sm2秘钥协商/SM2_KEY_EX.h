  Version:      V1.1
  Date:         Oct 9,2016
  Description:  implementation of SM2 Key Exchange Protocol
  Function List:
    1.SM2_Init            // initiate SM2 curve, should be called before any calculation on
curve.
    2.SM2_KeyEx_Init_I    // Step A1 to A3,the first host (initiator A) generates a random number
rA and
                          // calculates RA which the second host(responder B) receives
    3.SM2_KeyEx_Re_I      // Step B1 to B9, responder B generates RB, and calculates a secret
shared key
                          // out of RA and RB, RB should be sent the initiator A
    4.SM2_KeyEx_Init_II   // Step A4 to A10, initiator A calculates the secret key out of RA and
RB, and calculates a hash
                          // value which responder B might verifies
    5.SM2_KeyEx_Re_II     // Step B10 (optional) verifies the hash value received from initiator
A
    6.SM2_KeyEX_SelfTest  // test whether the calculation is correct by comparing the result with
the standard data
    7.SM2_W               //calculation of w
    8.SM3_Z               //calculation of ZA or ZB
    9.Test_Point          // test if the given point is on SM2 curve
    10.Test_Pubkey        // test if the given public key is valid
    11.SM2_KeyGeneration  //calculate a pubKey out of a given priKey
